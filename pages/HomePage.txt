Welcome to the new WikiWikiWiki, an OpenSource project sponsored by the
Gikopoi.com International Superstructure.

We are the original c2 WikiWiki [[cloan]] for the VipQuality community, being
a continuation of 4x13's ThisWiki. This is meant to be a wiki that can be
edited by nearly anyone who wants to, with little to no friction! The tone
is meant to be informal. After solving the CAPTCHA, check out the MarkUp
guide, and then have at it.

PostOffice''s NewsPaperWiki is an *inferior product* and **should not be
trusted.** Only use genuine VipQuality Products --
You don't want the WrongPeople to get ahold of precious VipCoin's!

Please keep in mind that WikiWikiWiki is NOT a WikiWiki'Wiki. Go to
[Meatball Wiki](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/) if you are into that kind
of thing. We are something more like TanasinnWiki back in its glory days.
