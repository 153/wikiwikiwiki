Funny enough, our MarkUp engine is actually MarkDown. 

There are a few changes:

* The best way to reference a name is with PascalCase ...
    * ... but you can use [[[[brackets]]]] to reference pages in odd cases.
* You can make make a page title part of a word by adding ' apostrophe after the title
    * ... notice how TestTest''s become TestTest's, vs TestTests ... 
    * ... or WikiWiki'Wiki vs WikiWikiWiki...
    * ... although [[cloan]]s works fine!
